# hypotenuse_calculator
Welcome to the Hypotenuse Calculator! This simple JavaScript project helps you find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle given its two legs.

How to Use:

Clone or download the project files.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Enter the lengths of the two legs (adjacent and opposite sides) in the designated input fields.
Click the "Calculate Hypotenuse" button.
The calculated hypotenuse length will be displayed on the screen.
Key Files:

index.html: Contains the HTML structure and user interface elements.
index.js: Contains the JavaScript code for performing the calculation.
Code Breakdown:

The code retrieves the values entered in the input fields using document.getElementById.
It applies the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) to calculate the hypotenuse.
The result is displayed in a designated element on the HTML page using innerHTML.
Additional Notes:

Ensure you have a web browser with JavaScript enabled.
For a more interactive experience, consider adding input validation and error handling.
Explore options for user-friendly input (e.g., sliders or number inputs).
Have fun exploring geometry with JavaScript!
